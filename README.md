# Cows-and-Bulls
It is a game where you have to guess numbers given by a player using hints.

It was the one and only program I built with my partner-in-crime, Adi. Itâ€™s also the first complete project I managed to cobble at the glorious dawn of my coding misadventures.

It is a game in which a person enter a 4-digit number and player have to guess the number using the hints(Cows and Bulls).
<br>
Cows - It represents number of correct digits present in the number.
<br>
Bulls - It represent the number of correct digits are in their correct position.
